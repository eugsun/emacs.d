(require 'multiple-cursors)

;; When you have an active region that spans multiple lines, the following will
;; add a cursor to each line:
(global-set-key (kbd "C-S-c C-S-c") 'mc/edit-lines)

;; When you want to add multiple cursors not based on continuous lines, but based on
;; keywords in the buffer, use:
(global-set-key (kbd "C->") 'mc/mark-next-like-this)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-<") 'mc/mark-previous-like-this)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-<") 'mc/mark-all-like-this)

;; First mark the word, then add more cursors.

;; To get out of multiple-cursors-mode, press `<return>` or `C-g`. The latter will
;; first disable multiple regions before disabling multiple cursors. If you want to
;; insert a newline in multiple-cursors-mode, use `C-j`.
